Welcome to the Code Agents HuggingFace Smolagents repository! This repository contains reviewed and personalized code examples inspired by the short course [Building Code Agents with Hugging Face smolagents](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/building-code-agents-with-hugging-face-smolagents/) offered on the [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/) platform,  focused on building code agents—large language model (LLM)-driven systems that generate and execute code to perform tasks. These agents offer a more streamlined and effective alternative to traditional tool-based systems. The examples emphasize secure implementation using Hugging Face’s smolagents framework, with particular attention to sandboxing techniques and safe code execution.  

The repository content is organized into the following hands-on modules, included in the accompanying notebook:  
 - _Introduction to Code Agents_ 🚀
 - _Secure Code Execution_ 🔐 
 - _Monitoring and Evaluating Your Agent_ 📊
 - _Build a Deep-Research Agent_ 🧠


❓ **What's Inside**  
- _Customized Code Examples_: Original examples from the courses have been reviewed, refined, and personalized for improved clarity and usability.  
- _Ready-to-Run Notebooks_: A pre-configured Jupyter notebook is provided for easy testing and modification, allowing you to quickly experiment with HuggingFace’s features. For detailed setup instructions, please refer to the [Setup Instructions](SETUP.md) file.  
- _Additional Resources_: Links to documentation, model hubs, and supplementary learning materials.
