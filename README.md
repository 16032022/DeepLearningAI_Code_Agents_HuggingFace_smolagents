What you'll learn
Understand the architecture and benefits of code agents that write code to perform tasks, compare them to traditional tool-calling agents, and learn when to use each approach.
Build and deploy secure code agents using Hugging Face‚Äôs smolagents, including techniques for sandboxing and safe execution of LLM-generated code.
Design, monitor, and evaluate single and multi-agent systems capable of handling tasks like web browsing, data extraction, and multi-step reasoning.
Tool-calling agents use large language models to write out multiple function calls sequentially to complete a complex sequence of tasks. They generate one function call, execute it, observe, reason, and then decide what to do next. Code agents take a different approach. They consolidate all these calls into a single block or snippet of code, letting the LLM lay out an entire plan of action at once.  That block can be executed efficiently, providing more reliable results.

In this short course, you‚Äôll learn how to build your own code agents using smolagents, a lightweight agentic framework from Hugging Face. Along the way, you‚Äôll explore real-world use cases, learn how to run LLM-generated code safely, and build an evaluation system that optimizes your code agent for production.

In detail, you‚Äôll learn:

How agentic systems have evolved, gaining greater levels of agency over time‚Äîand why code agents are the next big step.
The core idea of code agents and how they write their actions in code.
The benefits of code agents by comparing their performance to function-calling agents.
How to run code agents safely in your system using a constrained Python interpreter and sandboxing using E2B.
To trace, debug, and assess the code agent to optimize its behaviour as it handles a flow of complex requests.
How to build a research multi-agent system that can find information online and organize it into an interactive report.
